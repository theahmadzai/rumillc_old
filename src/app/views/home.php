    <h3>Saffron</h3>
    <p>Afghanistan produces approximately 0.6 percent of the word’s saffron. But has the potential to grow exponentially and the percentage is growing annually. In December 2012, Afghanistan’s saffron was awarded first place for quality among 16 countries at the international saffron exhibition held in France. The saffron produced in Afghanistan, according to the officials, was the best, surpassing the others with its perfume, color, and taste.</p>
    <p><b>Harvested:</b> November to early December</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-2" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Pomegranates</h3>
    <p>Many botanists believe that Afghanistan was the birthplace of the pomegranates. Afghanistan has a long and ancient history in pomegranate exports, but the country is seeing a surge in global demand with the newly discovered health benefits of pomegranate.</p>
    <p>The country is home to many unique, high quality pomegranate varieties that are renowned for their sweetness and juiciness.</p>
    <p><b>Harvested:</b> early September to late November</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-3" class="tabs__display">
     <h3>Apples</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan exports excellent apple varieties, including the Red delicious, the golden delicious, and the Gala. Grown mainly in central Afghanistan, these apples are distinctive for their size, deep red color, high brix content (very sweet), and crunchiness.</p>
     <p>Afghan apples maintain their flavor and freshness up to seven months in cold storage.</p>
      <p><b>Harvested:</b> late August to late November</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-4" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>grapes</h3>
      <p>Shondokhani, Kishmishi (or Thomson seedless), and Taifi are Afghanistan’s top-rated export varieties and some of the world’s best tasting grapes. A high brix level gives the fruit its distinctive sweetness.</p>
      <p>These varieties have a berry size staring from 16 mm and bigger. Their unique loose clustering gives the fruit a longer shelf life.</p>
      <p>Afghan farmers are moving away from the country’s traditional method of growing grapes close to the ground. They have begun to trellis their vineyards, improving the quality of their grapes by increasing ventilation and sunlight. Farmers often have a kish-mish khana, or raisin drying house, in their vineyards. This structure is made out of bricks and has lattice walls to allow ventilation for drying of the fruit.</p>
      <p>Raisins are an integral part of Afghanistan’s cuisine. In fact, Afghanistan’s national dish, Kabuli Palaw, is a rice dish mixed with raisins and carrots.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan grapes can last four to 10 weeks in cold storage and up to two weeks without refrigeration.</p>
      <p><b>Harvested:</b> mid-July to late September</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-5" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Melons</h3>
      <p>The start of summer brings a colorful display of the country’s melons at the markets. The melon’s rind ranges in color – dark green, light green, bright yellow, and pale yellow – and sizes – sometimes so large that two people are required to carry just one.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan’s melons are superior in taste &amp; quality. Of about 15 of the best local varieties, four stand out for their excellent taste: Zarmati from Kunduz, Jintoor from Mazar-e Sharif, Arkani from Acqcha, and Zarda from Kandahar. Afghan melons are famous throughout the region for their sweetness. Their tough skin gives the fruit an extended shelf life and maintains their delicious taste.</p>
      <p>Afghan melons retain their delicious fresh-harvest flavor for 20 days without refrigeration and up to 40 days in cold storage.</p>
      <p><b>Harvested:</b> Mid-July to late October</p>

    <h3>Apricots</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan has a long history of growing apricots and the local varieties are hardy and high quality. Afghan apricots are used both fresh and dried, with much of the dried fruit selling to markets in India, Russia, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic. Regarded as the best-tasting apricot, Afghanistan’s Amiri apricot is distinguished from other varieties by its sweetness, with a brix level of 14-22. The highest brix lelvel of apricots grown outside Afghanistan is only up to 14. The Amiri is one of the few hardy varieties that handle shipping and transport well.</p>
      <p>The Afghan apricot has a long shelf life and retains its sweetness for up to one week without refrigeration. It keeps long in cold storage.</p>

    <h3>Dried fruits &amp; Nuts</h3>
      <p>About 60 percent of the world’s dried fruit and nuts came from Afghanistan before the 1980s. Afghanistan’s dried fruit and nuts are widely sought after for their quality and variety. Afghanistan produces an array of nuts including pistachios, almonds, walnuts, and pine nuts, and its dried fruit include mulberries, apricots, figs, and green &amp; black raisins as well as chick peas and oleasters. Offering dried fruit and nuts to guests has been a staple of Afghan hospitality for centuries, and countries around the world are finally partaking in Afghanistan’s traditional delights.</p>

  <div id="tabs-8" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Juice</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan produces and exports high quality juice and juice concentrate from the country’s apples, grapes, peaches, cherries, and pomegranates. Consumers in markets from Pakistan, to the United Kingdom are enjoying Afghanistan’s juice made from organic fruit grown in the fields of local farmers and processed and packaged in modern facilities according to international safety standards.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-9" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Herbs &amp; seeds</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan has a favorable climate for growing a diverse array of herbs, roots, and seeds used for medicinal purposes or for spices in cuisine.</p>
      <p>Licorice, for example, is one of Afghanistan’s most profitable exports and one of its most common herbs. Licorice is versatile – used as a sweetener, in candies and for tobacco flavoring. The herb is also widely used for making licorice root tea and other herbal teas and for pharmaceutical purposes such as couch syrups and a treatment for sore throats.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan’s cumin seeds are used in cuisine, either whole or ground to flavor different kinds of rice. Cumin seeds have a strong and slightly bitter taste. Cumin, along with cinnamon, cloves, and black cardamom seeds, are the key ingredients of char masala, or four spices, which is a traditional afghan spice blend used to flavor a variety of Afghan dishes.</p>

    <h3>Carpets</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan is distinguished worldwide for its handmade carpets with superior quality, color and patterns. The weavers in Afghanistan, men and women, have an entrenched love and appreciation for the product. Afghanistan’s carpets reflect the country’s rich art, culture, and history through their exquisite hand-woven designs. Afghanistan produces several types’ handmade carpets, including felted wool carpets (nomads); flat, non-pile fabric woven carpets (kilims), and pile and knotted carpets made from wool, silk and cotton.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-11" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Marble</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan’s formidable mountains and gently rolling hills hide one of the country’s most lucrative treasures – marble. Afghanistan is home to 35 varieties of marble with 40 different colors. The country’s marble – in particular, its Chesht and Khogiani marble – have been compared to Carrarra marble, the Italian marble that is regarded as one of the highest quality marbles in the world. While Afghanistan’s marble ranks high in quality, the vast majority of its resevers are untouched and the industry is still small – with huge potential for growth.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan also has vast deposits of copper, iron, high-grade chrome ore, uranium, beryl, barite, lead, zinc, fluorspar, bauxite, and cobalt, lithium, gold and silver. According to some estimates, these reserves are so big and include so many minerals essential to modern industry that Afghanistan has the potential to become one of the most important mining centers in the world.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-12" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Gemstones</h3>
      <p>Rich veins of precious and semi-precious stones run deep beneath the ground in Afghanistan. Among the most unique stones is Afghanistan’s lapis lazuli, a deep blue stone used for jewelry and other decorative items. Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. In ancient Persia, lapis lazuli was a symbol of the starry night, and a favorite stone for protection from the evil eye.</p>
      <p>Veins of precious emeralds run through the Panjshir Valley and the mountains of the Hindu Kush that lie around 150 miles northeast of the capital – stones of a quality to rival the very best available from Columbia and Zambia from where most of the world’s supply currently emanates.</p>
      <p>Afghan miners also remove thousands of carats of red rubies, pink and violet kunzite, and tourmaline that come in a rainbow of colors.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-13" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Cashmere</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan is home to seven million goats and is the world’s third biggest producer of cashmere, behind China and Mongolia. Cashmere is the soft, warm undercoat of hair grown to protect Central Asian goats from cold winters.</p>
      <p>The industry is in its nascent stages with goat herders still learning of cashmere’s value. Afghan goat herders had traditionally cut the cashmere off the goat, reducing the value. They are now using cashmere combs to collect the delicate hair and preserve its length and integrity.</p>
      <p>The cashmere industry provides thousands of jobs for Afghan women, who wash and spin the cashmere and weave and knit it into high quality clothing.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-14" class="tabs__display">
    <h3>Fashion</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan is home to a small but fast growing and innovative group of fashion designers that are marrying the past with the present. The country’s clothing and accessories reflects its rich history and culture, but they could still find their unique place on the world’s runways.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan’s colorful tunics, regal kaftans, silk scarves, beaded purses, and detailed embroidery transfix with their elegance, color, and intricacy. The clothing and accessories also provide livelihood for Afghan women, allowing them to earn money and support their families by working from home.</p>
